The four temperaments map onto a 2×2 matrix of Pace (Fast/Slow) × Decision Style (Logic/Emotion).

---

## 1. Competitive (NT — Rational)

- **Key Question:** "Why are you the best option?" / "What can you do for me?"
- **Pace:** Fast | **Decision Style:** Logic
- **Core Need:** Proof of superiority, bottom-line results, credentials
- **Attracted by:** Competitive comparisons, ROI data, strong value propositions, awards, rankings, track record, qualifications
- **Repelled by:** Vagueness, emotional fluff without data, slow reveals, lack of proof, absence of competitive positioning
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Head-to-head comparisons, "why us" sections with evidence, performance metrics, awards/certifications, strong confident claims backed by data, clear value proposition

## 2. Spontaneous (SP — Artisan)

- **Key Question:** "Why should I act now?" / "What's the quick win?"
- **Pace:** Fast | **Decision Style:** Emotion
- **Core Need:** Excitement, immediate gratification, urgency, low friction
- **Attracted by:** Bold visuals, top sellers, new releases, limited-time offers, excitement-driven testimonials, fast path to action
- **Repelled by:** Walls of text, lengthy processes, heavy detail, slow reveals, complicated navigation, analysis-heavy content
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Urgency language ("today," "now," "limited"), bold imagery, prominent CTAs, short punchy copy, excitement/energy in tone, testimonials emphasizing quick results, streamlined purchase path

## 3. Humanistic (NF — Idealist)

- **Key Question:** "Who else uses this, and who stands behind it?" / "Who are you?"
- **Pace:** Slow | **Decision Style:** Emotion
- **Core Need:** Personal connection, trust, shared values, community, authenticity
- **Attracted by:** Customer stories, team bios, behind-the-scenes, reviews, community involvement, values-driven messaging, social proof from real people
- **Repelled by:** Cold/corporate tone, pure data without human element, aggressive sales tactics, lack of social proof, no visible people or stories
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Named testimonials with personal stories, team/founder bios, "about us" with human element, community references, values statements, empathy in language, real photos of real people

## 4. Methodical (SJ — Guardian)

- **Key Question:** "How does this work?" / "Can you prove it step by step?"
- **Pace:** Slow | **Decision Style:** Logic
- **Core Need:** Thorough detail, evidence, process documentation, guarantees
- **Attracted by:** Spec sheets, comparison charts, documentation, processes, FAQs, timelines, guarantees, data, case studies with methodology
- **Repelled by:** Hype without substance, missing details, no FAQ, no documentation, unsubstantiated claims, pressure tactics, lack of transparency
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Detailed specs/features, step-by-step explanations, FAQs, documentation links, guarantees/warranties, process diagrams, thorough comparison tables, fine print accessible

## Scoring Guidance

When rating how content appeals to each temperament:

**Strongly Attracts:** Content prominently features multiple signals for this temperament. A buyer of this type would feel the content was written for them.

**Attracts:** Content includes some signals for this temperament but they are not the primary focus. A buyer of this type would find enough to work with.

**Neutral:** Content neither specifically appeals to nor turns off this buyer type. Signals are absent but nothing actively repels.

**Repels:** Content includes elements that actively frustrate or alienate this buyer type (e.g., a Methodical buyer encountering hype with no specs).

**Strongly Repels:** Content is dominated by elements that directly oppose this temperament's needs. A buyer of this type would leave quickly.
