## Synthesis

### Primary Profile

[The bullseye audience this content is built for. Name the 1-2 strongest temperaments, 1-2 strongest decision pillars, and the 1-2 awareness levels the content targets. Describe this buyer in plain language — who are they, how do they think, and where are they in their journey?]

### Blind Spots

[Temperaments and decision pillars rated Neutral or below that represent missed opportunities. These are the buyer types being left out. Note which gaps are the most costly given the content type and likely audience.]

### Tension Flags

[Any contradictions or conflicting signals in the content — e.g., trying to be both "the industry standard" and "the contrarian choice," or mixing heavy urgency with slow-paced educational content. If none, state "No significant tensions detected."]

### Recommendations

[2-4 specific, actionable suggestions for broadening the content's psychological appeal without diluting its strengths. Each recommendation should name the gap it addresses (which temperament, pillar, or awareness level), describe the change, and explain why it helps. Prioritize the biggest gaps with the simplest fixes.]
