# Hughes 6MX Decision Pillars Reference

Source: Chase Hughes — Six-Minute X-Ray (6MX System)

The six decision pillars describe the dominant lens through which a person filters choices. Everyone uses all six to some degree, but one or two tend to dominate.

---

## 1. Deviance (Going Against the Grain)

- **Core Drive:** Standing apart, being different, rejecting the mainstream
- **They Ask:** "How is this different from what everyone else does?"
- **Attracted by:** Contrarian positioning, unconventional origin stories, "we broke the mold" framing, anti-establishment tone, insurgent brand identity, exclusivity for misfits/early adopters
- **Repelled by:** "Most popular," "#1 rated," mainstream/corporate messaging, "just like everyone else" positioning, safe/generic branding, mass-market testimonials
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Challenger brand language, "we're different because..." sections, founder rebellion stories, early-adopter framing, contrarian claims, "what the industry won't tell you"

## 2. Novelty (The New and Exciting)

- **Core Drive:** New experiences, cutting-edge, first-to-know
- **They Ask:** "What's new or exciting about this?"
- **Attracted by:** "Just launched," "breakthrough," new features, latest version, innovation language, patents, proprietary tech, emerging trends, "first of its kind"
- **Repelled by:** Stale/dated content, "established since 1952" without modernization, legacy feel, no signs of recent updates, traditional/old-school framing
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** "New," "just released," "updated," version numbers, innovation stories, tech-forward language, roadmap previews, recent dates, modern design, "breakthrough" framing

## 3. Social (What Will Others Think?)

- **Core Drive:** Status, perception, approval, belonging, social identity
- **They Ask:** "What will people think of me?"
- **Attracted by:** High-status testimonials, celebrity/influencer endorsements, media mentions, aspirational identity framing, community membership, "people like you choose this," shareability
- **Repelled by:** No social proof, no recognizable names, no community element, isolation/solo framing, products that feel embarrassing or low-status to own
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Logo bars ("trusted by"), endorsements, media logos, community features, referral programs, shareable elements, aspirational lifestyle imagery, "join" language

## 4. Conformity (Following the Proven Path)

- **Core Drive:** Safety in numbers, following norms, risk avoidance
- **They Ask:** "Is this what most people do?"
- **Attracted by:** "#1 rated," "most popular," high volume social proof (50,000+ customers), industry certifications, expert consensus, guarantees, risk reversal, established track record
- **Repelled by:** "Revolutionary" or "disruptive" framing that implies risk, lack of reviews/ratings, no guarantees, edgy/unconventional positioning, untested/new-to-market products
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Customer counts, star ratings, certification badges, "recommended by experts," money-back guarantees, "what most customers choose," default/suggested options, FAQ sections, comparison tables

## 5. Investment (Long-Term ROI)

- **Core Drive:** Cost-benefit analysis, long-term value, financial return
- **They Ask:** "What do I get back over time?"
- **Attracted by:** ROI calculations, TCO analysis, payback periods, case studies with specific numbers, transparent pricing, annual discounts, performance data, efficiency metrics
- **Repelled by:** Hidden pricing, vague value claims ("amazing results"), no financial data, pure emotional appeals, inability to quantify benefit, no case studies with numbers
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** Specific dollar amounts, percentages, time-to-value metrics, pricing tables, ROI calculators, "save X over Y months," detailed case studies with measurable outcomes, comparison of cost-of-inaction

## 6. Necessity (Just Get It Done)

- **Core Drive:** Pragmatic obligation, efficiency, solving the immediate problem
- **They Ask:** "Do I actually need to do this?"
- **Attracted by:** Direct/utilitarian language, speed of resolution, exact problem-solution fit, implementation timelines, reliability, support availability, streamlined processes, checklists
- **Repelled by:** Aspirational/lifestyle marketing, lengthy persuasion, brand storytelling without substance, feature bloat unrelated to the problem, unnecessary complexity, upsells during checkout
- **Content signals (present = attracts):** "Fix this in X hours," clear feature-to-need mapping, implementation details, support/SLA info, onboarding timelines, "get started now," minimal steps to purchase, problem-first language

## Scoring Guidance

When rating how content appeals to each decision pillar:

**Strongly Attracts:** Content prominently activates this decision lens. A person who filters decisions this way would feel compelled.

**Attracts:** Content includes some elements that activate this lens but it is not the dominant framing.

**Neutral:** Content does not specifically appeal to or conflict with this decision lens.

**Repels:** Content includes elements that actively conflict with this decision lens (e.g., heavy conformity messaging repels a deviance-driven buyer).

**Strongly Repels:** Content is dominated by elements directly opposed to this pillar. A buyer who decides through this lens would be pushed away.

### Important: Pillar Tensions

Some pillars naturally conflict. Content that strongly attracts one may repel another:
- **Deviance ↔ Conformity:** "We're different" vs "Everyone uses us" — these are inherently in tension.
- **Novelty ↔ Conformity:** "Brand new" vs "Proven and established" — newness implies risk to conformity buyers.
- **Deviance ↔ Social:** "I don't care what people think" vs "What will people think?" — though both can coexist if the social group is itself countercultural.

Acknowledge these tensions in the assessment rather than trying to resolve them. Effective content can thread the needle, but tradeoffs are real.
