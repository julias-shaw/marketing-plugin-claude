# Scoring Guide

Principles and edge-case guidance for consistent, well-calibrated ratings across all three
frameworks.

## Scoring Principles

**Ground every rating in observable evidence.** Never rate based on what the content *could*
include. Rate based on what's actually there. If there's no evidence for a dimension, the
default is Neutral (not Attracts).

**Distinguish "not addressed" from "actively repels."** Content that simply ignores Methodical
buyers (no specs, no FAQ, but also no hype) is Neutral. Content that is *all* hype, urgency,
and emotional pressure with zero substance actively repels Methodical buyers — that's Repels
or Strongly Repels.

**Respect the tension between pillars.** If content strongly activates Conformity ("most
popular choice, trusted by thousands"), it will likely score lower on Deviance — and that's
expected, not a flaw. Note the tradeoff rather than penalizing it.

**For customer profiles, match language to frameworks.** When a VoC quote says "I just need
something that works, I don't have time to research," that's strong Necessity + Spontaneous
signal. When they say "I spent weeks comparing every option before choosing," that's
Methodical + Investment. Let the customer's own words drive the ratings.

**The awareness level rating is about fit, not quality.** A brilliant Most Aware sales page
(discount code, buy button, zero education) would score Neutral for Unaware — and that's
correct. The content isn't bad; it's just not built for that stage.

## Edge Cases

**Mixed content (e.g., full website with multiple pages):** Assess the overall impression. If
distinct pages serve different functions (homepage vs. pricing vs. about), note which pages
serve which profiles. The primary rating should reflect the aggregate experience.

**Very short content (e.g., a single ad or headline):** Short content naturally covers fewer
dimensions. Rate what's present and mark unaddressed dimensions as Neutral. Don't over-infer
from limited material — note the constraint in the synthesis.

**VoC quotes that contradict each other:** If the VoC set comes from multiple customers,
different quotes may map to different profiles. Note this explicitly — it likely means the
customer base is psychologically diverse, which is useful information for the user.

**Content in a non-English language:** Apply the same frameworks. Buyer psychology is
cross-cultural, though cultural context may shift which pillars are baseline expectations vs.
differentiators. Note any relevant cultural considerations.
