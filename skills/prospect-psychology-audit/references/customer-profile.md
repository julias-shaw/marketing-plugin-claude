## Synthesis

### Primary Profile

[The psychological portrait of this customer. Name the 1-2 dominant temperaments, 1-2 dominant decision pillars, and the awareness level(s) where they typically engage. Describe this buyer in plain language — how do they think, what drives their decisions, and what stage are they usually at when they start evaluating?]

### Blind Spots

[Temperaments and decision pillars this customer does not exhibit. These are dimensions that messaging should *not* lead with for this audience — not because they're flaws, but because this customer doesn't filter decisions through these lenses. Useful for knowing what won't land.]

### Tension Flags

[Any contradictions in the customer profile — e.g., VoC quotes that show both novelty-seeking and conformity-seeking, or an ICP that describes both impulsive and methodical behavior. If the input contains multiple customers, note where individual profiles diverge and what that means for the diversity of the customer base. If none, state "No significant tensions detected."]

### Messaging Implications

[Based on this customer's psychological profile, provide 2-4 actionable implications for how to communicate with them effectively. Each should name the relevant framework dimension and translate it into a concrete messaging principle. For example:

- "This customer's dominant Methodical temperament means product pages need detailed specs, process documentation, and comparison tables *before* the CTA — not behind it."
- "The strong Necessity signal suggests lead messaging should surface deadlines, compliance triggers, or cost-of-inaction data rather than aspirational benefits."
- "Since this customer engages at the Product Aware stage, top-of-funnel educational content is unlikely to reach them — invest in case studies, objection handling, and trial experiences instead."

Also note what messaging approaches to *avoid* based on the profile's weak or repelling dimensions.]
