# Migration: market-research v1.3.0 → v1.4.0

v1.4.0 restructured the skill output from a single monolithic dossier to a multi-file
research package using subagent architecture. This is a significant structural change.

---

## What Changed

In v1.3.0, the skill produced:
- A single `market-research-dossier.md` containing all phases
- `voice-of-customer.csv` + `.meta`

In v1.4.0, the skill produces a directory `market-research-{slug}/` containing:
- `00-inputs.md` — research inputs
- `01-market-snapshot.md` — Phase 1 output
- `02-voice-of-customer.md` — Phase 2 output (~160 categorized quotes)
- `03-psychographic-profile.md` — Phase 3 output (themed clusters)
- `04-awareness-motivation-map.md` — Phase 4 output (three strategy tables)
- `05-feature-desire-bridge.md` — Phase 5 output (feature mapping table)
- `voice-of-customer.csv` + `.meta` — same as before
- `research-summary.md` — lightweight summary linking all phase files

---

## Recommendation

**Rerun the skill from scratch** for the full v1.4.0 experience. The subagent architecture
produces deeper research with more quotes from more sources, and the multi-file format is
designed to work as an integrated package.

Splitting a monolithic dossier into properly structured phase files with executive summaries,
YAML frontmatter, and the new format is impractical to automate well — the content
organization is fundamentally different.

## Best-Effort Partial Migration

If the user wants to preserve their existing research and cannot rerun, perform this
partial migration:

### Step 1: Create Output Directory

Create a directory named `market-research-{slug}/` (derive slug from the product name in
the dossier).

### Step 2: Update Dossier Frontmatter

Update the frontmatter at the top of the existing dossier:

```
---
skill_version: 1.4.0
skill_name: market-research
migrated_from: 1.3.0
migrated_at: {today's date as YYYY-MM-DD}
---
```

### Step 3: Split Sections into Phase Files

Extract sections from the dossier into separate files. For each file, add YAML frontmatter:

```
---
skill_version: 1.4.0
skill_name: market-research
phase: {phase identifier}
migrated_from: 1.3.0
---
```

- **Section 1 (Market Snapshot)** → `01-market-snapshot.md` with `phase: 1-market-snapshot`
- **Section 2 (Voice of Customer)** → `02-voice-of-customer.md` with `phase: 2-voice-of-customer`
- **Section 3 (Psychographic Profile)** → `03-psychographic-profile.md` with `phase: 3-psychographic-profile`
- **Section 4 (Awareness & Motivation Map)** → `04-awareness-motivation-map.md` with `phase: 4-awareness-motivation-map`
- **Section 5 (Feature-to-Desire Bridge)** → `05-feature-desire-bridge.md` with `phase: 5-feature-desire-bridge`

### Step 4: Create Inputs File

Create `00-inputs.md` by extracting the persona, product, and problems from the dossier
content. Add frontmatter with `skill_version: 1.4.0`.

### Step 5: Move CSV Files

Move `voice-of-customer.csv` and `voice-of-customer.csv.meta` into the output directory.
Update the `.meta` file's `skill_version` to `1.4.0`.

### Step 6: Rename Original Dossier

Rename the original dossier to `research-summary.md` in the output directory. This serves
as the summary file, though it will have the old monolithic format rather than the new
lightweight summary format.

## Post-Migration Message

After completing all steps, tell the user:

> **Migration complete: v1.3.0 → v1.4.0 (partial)**
>
> Updated:
> - Created multi-file output directory with individual phase files
> - Updated all frontmatter to v1.4.0
> - Moved CSV and meta files into the output directory
> - Renamed original dossier as summary file
>
> **What couldn't be migrated automatically:**
> - Executive summaries for each phase file (new in v1.4.0 — not present in old format)
> - The lightweight summary format (the old monolithic dossier is used as the summary instead)
> - Deeper research from parallel per-site subagents (the v1.4.0 architecture searches more
>   sources in parallel, which produces broader coverage)
> - Incremental writing / failure resilience (only applies during live research)
>
> For the full v1.4.0 experience with deeper research and the new summary format, rerun
> the market-research skill from scratch.
