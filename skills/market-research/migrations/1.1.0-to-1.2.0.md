# Migration: market-research v1.1.0 → v1.2.0

Follow these steps to upgrade a v1.1.0 market research dossier to v1.2.0 format.

---

## Step 1: Add YAML Frontmatter

Insert YAML frontmatter at the very top of the dossier, before the `# Market Research Dossier`
heading:

```
---
skill_version: 1.2.0
skill_name: market-research
migrated_from: 1.1.0
migrated_at: {today's date as YYYY-MM-DD}
---
```

---

## Step 2: Extract Quotes to CSV

If no `voice-of-customer.csv` file exists alongside the dossier, create one by extracting all
quotes from Section 2 (Voice of Customer).

For each quote found in the dossier:

| CSV Column | How to Populate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Quote | The verbatim quote text (without surrounding quotation marks) |
| Date | "Date Unknown" (old-format dossiers may not have dates on all quotes) |
| Type | Infer from the citation: "Reddit" if source mentions r/, "Review" if from a review site, "Forum" for forums, "YouTube" for YouTube, "Quora" for Quora, "Social" for social media, "Other" if unclear |
| URL | Extract from the citation link if present, otherwise leave empty |
| Source | Extract the specific source name from the citation (e.g. "r/productivity", "Amazon", "TrustPilot") |
| Author | "Unknown" (old-format dossiers may not have author attribution) |
| Category | Derive from the section heading the quote appears under: Fears→Fear, Frustrations→Frustration, Wants→Want, Beliefs→Belief, Joys→Joy, Objections→Objection, Triggers→Trigger, Comparisons→Comparison |

CSV rules:
- Use double quotes around every field value
- Escape any double quotes inside field values by doubling them
- Include the header row
- One row per quote, no blank rows

---

## Step 3: Create CSV Meta File

Create a companion file named `voice-of-customer.csv.meta`:

```yaml
skill_name: market-research
skill_version: 1.2.0
created_at: {today's date as YYYY-MM-DD}
columns: Quote,Date,Type,URL,Source,Author,Category
```

---

## Step 4: Add Missing Sections

v1.2.0 introduced three new Voice of Customer categories. If the dossier is missing any of
these sections under "## 2. Voice of Customer", add them:

### Objections

> *No objection quotes were collected in the original v1.1.0 research. Rerun Phase 2 to
> populate this section with authentic customer objections.*

### Triggers

> *No trigger quotes were collected in the original v1.1.0 research. Rerun Phase 2 to
> populate this section with authentic buying trigger moments.*

### Comparisons

> *No comparison quotes were collected in the original v1.1.0 research. Rerun Phase 2 to
> populate this section with authentic competitor comparison language.*

If any of these sections already exist with content, leave them as-is.

---

## Step 5: Update "How to Use This Dossier"

Add these bullets to the "How to Use This Dossier" section if they are not already present:

- **For objection handling:** Use Objections quotes (Section 2) + Won't Tell and Can't Tell columns (Section 4)
- **For retargeting & win-back:** Use Triggers (Section 2) to time messages around catalytic moments
- **For competitive positioning:** Use Comparisons (Section 2) to address how prospects evaluate alternatives
- **For spreadsheet analysis:** Import `voice-of-customer.csv` to filter, sort, and pivot quotes by category, source, or date

---

## Step 6: Add Companion File Section

If the dossier does not already have a "Companion file" section at the end, add:

```
## Companion file: voice-of-customer.csv

All Voice of Customer quotes (Section 2) are also exported to `voice-of-customer.csv` for
filtering, sorting, and importing into other tools. Columns:
`Quote,Date,Type,URL,Source,Author,Category`
```

## Post-Migration Message

After completing all steps, tell the user:

> **Migration complete: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0**
>
> Updated:
> - Added version frontmatter for future migration tracking
> - Extracted existing quotes to `voice-of-customer.csv` with companion `.meta` file
> - Added placeholder sections for Objections, Triggers, and Comparisons
> - Updated "How to Use This Dossier" with new guidance
> - Added companion file reference
>
> **What couldn't be backfilled automatically:**
> - Quote dates (set to "Date Unknown" — original research may not have captured dates)
> - Quote authors (set to "Unknown" — original format didn't track authors)
> - Objections, Triggers, and Comparisons content (these categories are new in v1.2.0)
> - Quote verification status (cannot re-verify without re-visiting sources)
>
> To get the full v1.2.0 experience with complete data, rerun the market-research skill from
> scratch. The migrated dossier preserves all your existing research while adding the new
> structural elements.
