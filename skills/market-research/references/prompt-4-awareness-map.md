# Prompt 4: Awareness & Motivation Map

**Purpose:** Map customer questions across Schwartz's five awareness stages, build desire
ladders that drill three levels deep, and expose what customers will say publicly vs. what
they hide vs. what they can't articulate. This is the strategic bridge between understanding
your customer and writing copy that moves them to action.

## Template

GOAL: Produce three strategic analysis tables that map the customer journey from unaware to
ready-to-buy, reveal layered motivations, and expose hidden drivers.

CONTEXT:
- Ideal customer persona: {PERSONA}
- Product being sold: {PRODUCT}
- Problems the product solves: {PROBLEMS}

TASK:

1. MARKET AWARENESS LEVELS (Schwartz lens)
   Build a table with five columns representing awareness stages:
   - Unaware: Doesn't know they have a problem
   - Problem Aware: Knows the problem, not the solutions
   - Solution Aware: Knows solutions exist, not your product
   - Product Aware: Knows your product, not convinced yet
   - Most Aware: Ready to buy, just needs the right offer

   For each stage, list the key questions a prospect would naturally ask, using their
   authentic language.

2. MARKET DESIRES EXPANSION
   Identify 5–10 explicit desires this audience expresses.
   For each desire, build a "So I can..." ladder — ask "why?" three times to reveal
   deeper motives.

   Table format:
   | Desire | So I can... (Level 1) | So I can... (Level 2) | So I can... (Level 3) |

3. WILL / WON'T / CAN'T TELL TABLE
   For every desire identified above, capture three layers of candor:
   - Will Tell: What they'll happily say out loud to anyone
   - Won't Tell: What feels too private, embarrassing, or vulnerable to admit
   - Can't Tell: Hidden or subconscious drivers they may not even recognize in themselves

   Table format:
   | Desire | Will Tell | Won't Tell | Can't Tell |

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return all three tables in order, clearly labeled. Use language that feels real and human —
pull from actual community discussions where possible. Tables should be clean enough to
copy directly into a doc or spreadsheet.
