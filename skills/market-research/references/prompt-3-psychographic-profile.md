# Prompt 3: Psychographic Profile

**Purpose:** Build a deep psychographic map that goes beyond individual quotes to reveal
thematic patterns in how customers think, identify, struggle, dream, and face obstacles.
Minimum 80 quotes organized by theme with pattern notes.

**When running this prompt:** Use web search to find real conversations. Focus on clustering
quotes by theme — the goal is patterns, not a random list.

## Template

GOAL: Produce an in-depth psychographic profile across four dimensions — Identity, Problems,
Dreams/Desires, and Obstacles — so that copy can sound like it was written from inside the
community.

NOTE: Reuse relevant quotes from Phase 2 (Voice of Customer) where they fit a theme —
do not discard duplicates. A quote can appear in both Phase 2 and Phase 3 if it serves
both an emotional category and a psychographic theme. Seek additional quotes beyond Phase 2
to fill thematic gaps and meet the minimum count.

CONTEXT:
- Ideal customer persona: {PERSONA}
- Product being sold: {PRODUCT}
- Problems the product solves: {PROBLEMS}

TASK:
1. Locate active conversations in relevant online communities. Focus on posts and comments
   from the last six months.

2. For each of the four categories below, identify at least five distinct THEMES. Under
   every theme, collect 2–4 word-for-word quotes (preserving slang, typos, emotion):

   IDENTITY — How do they see themselves? What labels, roles, or identities do they claim?
   PROBLEMS — What specific struggles do they face? What keeps them up at night?
   DREAMS / DESIRES — What do they want their life or situation to look like?
   OBSTACLES — What stands between them and their goals? What's held them back?

3. Label every quote with its source (subreddit, forum, review site) for traceability.

4. Date every quote. After the source, include the post date in parentheses, formatted like
   (Jan 3, 2025). If the page doesn't show the date, check the Wayback Machine
   (web.archive.org) to find when it was first archived. Write (Date Unknown) if no date
   can be determined.

5. Verify every quote. Before saving a quote, re-visit the source URL and confirm the quote
   actually appears on the page. If it cannot be found, discard it and find a real
   replacement. Every quote must exist verbatim at its cited source.

6. After each theme, write a short "Pattern" note that summarizes the insight across its
   quotes — not just what they're saying, but what it reveals about how they think.

7. When all quotes are collected, write a 5–6 sentence persona sketch capturing the
   persona's mindset, daily challenges, and driving motivations, using only insights from
   your research.

8. Quality check: Confirm at least 20 quotes per category (minimum 80 total).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a clean document structured as:

IDENTITY
  Theme 1: [theme name]
    "Quote one." — [source] (Mon D, YYYY)
    "Quote two." — [source] (Date Unknown)
    Pattern: [insight]
  Theme 2: [theme name]
    ...

PROBLEMS
  Theme 1: ...
  (continue through all four categories)

PERSONA SKETCH
  Five to six plain-language sentences bringing the audience to life.
