# Prompt 1: Market Snapshot

**Purpose:** Establish a clear strategic foundation — who we're targeting, what we're selling,
what problems we solve. This output feeds into every subsequent step.

**Additional inputs needed:**
- Brand website URL (if available)
- 1–2 competitor URLs (if available)

**When running this prompt:** If URLs were provided, use web search to pull real data from
them. Ground the snapshot in actual facts — don't fabricate positioning.

## Template

GOAL: Generate a short, high-clarity writeup that answers three questions: Who are we
targeting, what are we selling, and what problems are we solving?

CONTEXT:
- Ideal customer persona: {PERSONA}
- Product being sold: {PRODUCT}
- Problems the product solves: {PROBLEMS}
- Brand website: {WEBSITE_URL}
- Competitor sites: {COMPETITOR_URLS}

TASK:
Analyze the brand's website and competitor sites (if provided). Write a few short paragraphs
that clearly and confidently answer the three context questions. Keep language simple and
human. Avoid marketing fluff.

Include:
- A one-paragraph sketch of the customer persona (demographics, psychographics, motivations)
- A 1–2 sentence description of the product and how it's positioned
- A short explanation of the core problems this product helps the customer resolve

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a written summary in plain paragraphs, not a list or table. Write as if handing it off
to a strategist who needs to understand the market at a glance before diving deeper.
